# Implementation of the game tic-tac-toe using the _AlphaZero_ algorithm

_Authors: Emma Demarecaux, Charles Desaleux, Romain Fabre_

We compare the performances of the _AlphaZero_ algorithm against others to make a bot that plays tic-tac-toe. The file `tic_tac_toe.py` contains the environment of the game. 

The folder `agents` contains all the tic-tac-toe algorithms that we implemented.

## Set up

To launch the program, open a terminal and run from the root directory
```
python -m main
```
