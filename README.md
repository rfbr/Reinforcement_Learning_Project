_Authors: Emma Demarecaux, Charles Desaleux, Romain Fabre_

We used the _AlphaZero_ algorithm to make a bot that plays tic-tac-toe. The file `tictactoe.py` contains the environment of the game.

## Set up

To launch the program, open a terminal and run from the root directory
```
$ python -m main
```
